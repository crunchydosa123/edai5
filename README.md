# Global Peace Scoring System
## Problem Statement
The lack of a standardized and universally accepted metric to evaluate peace poses a significant challenge for policymakers, governments, and organizations dedicated to fostering peace. Without a clear and consistent way to measure peace, efforts to promote and sustain it are often fragmented and inefficient. The GPSS seeks to bridge this gap by creating a scoring system that not only evaluates peace but also provides actionable insights to promote it at various levels, from local communities to global regions.

## Objective
The primary objective of the Global Peace Scoring System is to develop a robust and data-driven scoring system that measures peace using various socio-economic and behavioral indicators. This system will serve as a tool for policymakers, NGOs, and international organizations to assess the state of peace, identify areas of improvement, and implement targeted strategies to enhance peace across different regions.
